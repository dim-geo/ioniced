What is ioniced? 
-------------------

It's a very simple daemon to set the io scheduling class and priority for processes
while running them. That's done by ionice (http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/)
Please read the man page of ionice before using this tool.

Use ioniced at your _OWN_ risk!
You must agree before using ioniced.


How it works?
-------------

It scans /proc for new PIDs. After looking into /proc/pid/exec and
/proc/pid/status to get the process' name it looks into it's config and runs 
ionice if neccassary. 

Currently it looks into /proc every 2 seconds (default; use [-u sec] to 
overwrite).  Is there a better way to get notified when a process is started?
Let me know!


How to get it running?
----------------------

Install ionice into PATH.
Unpack ionice tarball.
Compile via "make".
Install via "make install" into /usr/bin.
Run "ioniced -h" to get a quick overview about command line options.
Now go and configure (see below). 


How to configure?
-----------------

Place an ioniced.conf in /etc with following format:
  [%group:|user:]   program-name    ionice parameter

# Note:
#   Rules are parsed from top downwards. The first rule matches is valid!

# WARNING: 
#   Adding programms without absolute paths could be used to make your computer
#   unusable!

# WARNING:
#   Wildcards are also valid for directories!

Settings per user or group are supported.

Look at example/ioniced.conf for more information and more examples.

This program is a copy of schedtoold (http://www.darav.de/schedtoold.html) 
and it has the same functionality but for io scheduler.
